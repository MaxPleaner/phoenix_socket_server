# About

There's a certain kind of app I like to build in order to learn a websocket framework. I've done it in Rails, Sinatra, Express, Meteor, and now Phoenix.

Basically the app authenticates you, then shows you a list of online users. You can send them direct messages. That's the gist of it.

This is deployed to heroku: [hidden-inlet-64920.herokuapp.com](https://hidden-inlet-64920.herokuapp.com)

For a broad-level tutorial on how this site was put together, see [this writeup](./writeup.md)

# Running

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
