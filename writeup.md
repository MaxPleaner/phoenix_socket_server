_note: this is just the sequence of steps I took. It doesn't have to be done in this order_.

1. Generate a new phoenix app.
2. Configure the database.
3. Create a simple websocket channel that echoes input and prints it to the page.
4. Follow Heroku's instructions to prepare for deployment
5. Add the [addict](https://github.com/trenpixster/addict) library and run it's generators. For simplicity's sake, skip the mailer generator. Test that registration and login works.
6. Look in the docs of Phoenix.Token. There are instructions to pass credentials along with websocket requests. This involves printing the token to the HTML page and then sending it from the client with the initial socket connect request. It also requires overriding the `connect` method in `user_socket.ex`
7. Use Phoenix.Presence to track which users are online. This involves two events which need to be handled on the client: `presence_state` (fired on initial page load) and `presence_diff`.
8. On the client, subscribe to a channel for each online user. This is the direct message channel. Make a server handler for authenticating the user (is able to send this direct message?) and forwarding the message. 
9. Generate a JSON API for a message object. Only the index route is necessary (unless you want to make delete/update routes too). Have the client request the message list (for each room) when the direct-message channel is opened. Create a message record from the websocket handler for the create-direct-message route.

_other notes:_

- initially, I used the [guardian](https://github.com/ueberauth/guardian) library on top of addict for JWT support. However I realized that I could get the same functionality with Phoenix' builtin token generator, so I removed it.
